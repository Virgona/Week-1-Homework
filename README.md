# Week-1-Homework
## Job Ticket Challenge - Refactoring

This is a basic webpage template. I was given the code as a challenge for this bootcamp. The challange was to correct and identify HTML semantics and clean up the CSS.

### Motovation
Its like puzzle. I have fun working on puzzles and learning these new skills adds a complexity to the puzzle that makes it really satisfying to complete. I was motovated to complete this task to the best of my ability and to the highest standard I feel I could achieve through my desire to learn and my own huebris in wanting to overome the challenge 

### Problem Solving
This challenge solved a lot of my personal problems in what I had and had not understood about HTML and CSS. Through this challenge I gained a deeper understanding of how selectors work and the impact the slightest change of code can have on a page. Especially when I spent the first few days working on it I completely misunderstood how the CSS was meant to look and I basically recoded the entre thing only to screw up the page, have to abandon my work and start again entirely from scratch.

### What I learned
This challenge taught me not to overthink or complicate the code. After my blunder and resetting the entire project I reached out to ASKBCS because I was having trouble trying to make an accessibility change to the background image. The image was loaded in using CSS and to spite all my attempts to apply an alt text I couldnt figure it out. 
The kind heart talked me through and I found that I could just add a "title=" in the class call and it would suppliment the alt text if the image were to not load.

Using google I was able to figure out how to make links that once clicked take a user to a particular element on the page - this I applied to all 3 listed words in top right corner and they now take you to their respective descriptions
